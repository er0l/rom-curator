# ROM Curator

![ROM Curator](images/rom-curator.png)

ROM Curator is a Python tool for inventorying and eventually exporting curated
views of a large retro ROM archive stored on a NAS.

The project is being built in phases. The current implementation supports safe
metadata inventory, system mapping, device profiles, reporting, cautious
hardlink export builds, ROMM metadata sync, compatibility filtering, and
EmulationStation gamelist generation.  It does not modify ROM files.

## Goals

- Keep one canonical master ROM archive.
- Inventory large ROM libraries safely, including multi-terabyte NAS archives.
- Support target ecosystems such as EmuDeck, R36S/R39 Max, Batocera, and ROMM.
- Normalize system names through a mapping matrix instead of hardcoded folder logic.
- Create curated exports using hardlinks only.

## Safety Rules

- Inventory scans do not modify ROM files.
- No files are moved, copied, renamed, or deleted from the ROM archive.
- SQLite metadata is the only thing updated during inventory.
- Export commands only write under the configured exports directory.
- `build` and `sync` dry-run unless `--execute` is passed.
- Destructive export cleanup requires explicit confirmation with `--yes`.

## Current Features

### Inventory

Run a streaming filesystem scan of the configured ROM archive:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py inventory
```

Scope the scan to one or more system folders to pick up changes quickly
without walking the entire archive:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py inventory --systems switch
python3 romcurator.py inventory --systems gba,nes,snes
```

When `--systems` is used, stale-row removal is also scoped to those folders
so the rest of the database is never touched.

The scanner captures:

- system from the top-level folder
- filename
- extension
- absolute path
- relative path
- size
- modified time
- parsed title
- region
- revision
- beta/prototype/translation/hack flags

The scanner is designed for large libraries:

- uses streaming `os.walk`
- does not build a giant file list in memory
- avoids hashing large ROM files
- uses `size:mtime` scan keys
- commits SQLite writes in batches

### Incremental Rescans

The inventory database tracks every file in a `scan_state` table:

```sql
scan_state(path, scan_key, last_seen)
```

On later scans, unchanged files are skipped while their `last_seen` timestamp is
updated. If a file disappears from disk, stale rows are removed from both
`roms` and `scan_state` after the scan completes.

### SQLite Scaling

The database layer enables performance-oriented SQLite settings:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY;
PRAGMA mmap_size=30000000000;
```

The database currently uses these tables:

- `roms`
- `scan_state`

Indexes exist for common query paths such as system, title, region, extension,
path, and scan state freshness.

### Filename Parsing

The parser handles common ROM naming tags such as:

```text
Chrono Trigger (USA) (Rev 1).sfc
```

It extracts useful metadata such as:

- title: `Chrono Trigger`
- region: `USA`
- revision: `Rev 1`
- beta/prototype/demo/translation/hack flags

### Reports

Generate inventory reports:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py report
```

Scope a report to one or more systems:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py report --systems switch
python3 romcurator.py report --systems switch,ps3
```

Reports include:

- total files / games
- total size
- systems by size (shows game count for folder-based systems, file count otherwise)
- extension breakdown
- largest ROMs
- region breakdown
- possible duplicates

Scoped reports have no row-count limit, drop the redundant Systems by Size
table when only one system is requested, and are saved with the system
name(s) in the filename.

### System Mapping Matrix

System aliases live in:

```text
mappings/systems.yaml
```

Print and validate the mapping matrix:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py mappings
```

The matrix maps canonical ROM Curator names to target ecosystem folders:

- NAS
- ROMM
- EmuDeck
- R36S/R39 Max
- Batocera

#### Subpath NAS folders

A system's `nas:` entry in `systems.yaml` can be a subpath like
`arcade/mame2003-plus`. Inventory, export, and all other commands resolve it
automatically. When scanning the parent system (`arcade`), its subpath child
is skipped so files are never double-counted. The Batocera layout maps the
child to `mame/mame2003-plus` so it lands in Batocera's expected subfolder.

#### Folder-based systems

Some systems store each game as a subfolder containing multiple files
(e.g. ScummVM data files, DOS games, Switch titles with update packages).
Two flags control how these are handled:

| Flag | Systems | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `folder_based: true` | scummvm, dos, windows, megacd, switch | Game count uses unique subfolders instead of raw file count; exporter exports all files in a subfolder as one unit |
| `subfolder_exclude: true` | scummvm, dos, windows, megacd | Subfolder files are untagged game data — excluded from region breakdown and duplicate detection |

Switch uses `folder_based` only (not `subfolder_exclude`) because its
depth-3 files are the actual ROM with proper No-Intro naming (including
region tags). Only depth-4+ files (`GameName/updates/`) are excluded.

### Device Profiles

Device profile rules live in:

```text
profiles/
```

Current profiles:

- `batocera.yaml`: bartop arcade cabinet — i5-8500T, 1 stick, 12 buttons, wireless keyboard+trackpad
- `steamdeck.yaml`: Steam Deck LCD — EmuDeck, dual analogue + trackpads
- `r36s.yaml`: R36S handheld — 640×480, dual analogue, 100 games/system cap
- `r39max.yaml`: R39 Max handheld — 720×720 square screen, dual analogue
- `odroidgosuper.yaml`: Odroid Go Super — 854×480, dual analogue

Print and validate all profiles:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py profiles
```

Inspect one profile and its target folder aliases:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py profile r36s
```

Profiles drive export planning and hardlink builds.

### Export Engine

Explain what a profile would export:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py explain r36s
```

Dry-run an export build:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py build r36s
```

Create hardlinks:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py build r36s --execute
```

Exports are written under:

```text
<exports>/<profile-name>/<target-system>/
```

For example:

```text
/mnt/storage/exports/r36s/gba/
/mnt/storage/exports/steamdeck/genesis/
```

The export engine:

- uses hardlinks only
- never copies ROM data
- selects one preferred region per title
- skips beta/prototype/hack files unless the profile allows them
- filters by ROMM metadata when `romm-sync` has been run (see below)
- filters by hardware compatibility when compat lists are present (see below)
- honors `max_games_per_system`
- refuses to overwrite conflicting existing files
- supports `--rebuild --yes` for a profile export directory
- supports `sync --prune --yes` for stale exported files

Profile `selection:` keys that drive export filtering:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `include_beta` | bool | `false` | Include beta ROMs |
| `include_proto` | bool | `false` | Include prototype ROMs |
| `include_hacks` | bool | `false` | Include ROM hacks |
| `include_translations` | bool | `true` | Include fan translations |
| `arcade_dedupe` | bool | `true` | Group MAME clones by parent — export one ROM per unique game |
| `arcade_skip_non_playable` | bool | `true` | Skip mechanical (AWP/fruit machine/pachinko) ROMs. BIOS and device ROMs are always exported regardless — many games depend on them at runtime (e.g. `neogeo.zip` for all Neo Geo games). |
| `arcade_exclude_controls` | list | `[]` | Skip arcade games needing listed MAME control types (e.g. `[wheel, spinner, trackball, lightgun]`). Has no effect until `arcade-import` is run from a full `mame -listxml` source. |
| `mame_versions` | list | *(off)* | Restrict arcade ROMs to machines present in these versioned romsets (e.g. `[mame2003, mame2003-plus]`). Requires `arcade-import --version` for each listed version. Non-arcade systems are unaffected. |
| `year_from` | int | *(off)* | Skip games released before this year. Games with no year data always pass. Can be overridden per-run with `--from YEAR`. |
| `year_to` | int | *(off)* | Skip games released after this year. Games with no year data always pass. Can be overridden per-run with `--to YEAR`. |
| `min_rating` | number | *(off)* | Skip ROMs with a real IGDB score below this value. Unrated ROMs (`total_rating = 0`) and ROMs with no ROMM record always pass. |
| `identified_only` | bool | `false` | Skip ROMs that ROMM considers unidentified. ROMs with no ROMM record always pass. |
| `compat_chip` | string | *(off)* | Enable hardware compatibility filtering using compat lists for this chip (e.g. `rk3326`). |
| `compat_min_playability` | string | `Ok` | Minimum playability level to include. Levels: `Good` > `Ok` > `Ok/Medium` > `Medium` > `Mediocre` > `None`. |
| `compat_include_unlisted` | bool | `true` | Include ROMs with no compatibility entry (unlisted = unpenalised). |
| `compat_unlisted_exclude` | list | `[]` | Systems where only confirmed-compatible ROMs pass — unlisted ROMs are excluded. Use for systems with high compat list coverage (e.g. `[dreamcast, naomi, atomiswave, saturn]`). |

ROMM-based filters require `romm-sync` to have been run first. If the `romm_roms`
table is empty, `min_rating` and `identified_only` have no effect.

Compatibility filters require `compat-import` to have been run first (see below).

### Multi-Disc Game Support

The inventory parser detects disc tags from filenames and stores them in a `disc` column:

```text
Final Fantasy VII (Europe) (Disc 1).cue  →  disc = "(Disc 1)"
Final Fantasy VII (Europe) (Disc 2).cue  →  disc = "(Disc 2)"
```

Supported patterns: `(Disc N)`, `(Disk N)`, `(Side A/B)`, `(Tape N)`, `(Part N)`.

During export, each disc is treated as an independent selection slot, so all discs
of a multi-disc game are included rather than only the first one being picked.

### ROMM Metadata Sync

Fetch and cache ROMM metadata into `inventory.sqlite`:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py romm-sync
python3 romcurator.py romm-sync --reset  # wipe and re-sync
```

ROMM metadata is stored in a `romm_roms` table and joined to the `roms` table
on `(canonical_system, filename)` at query time. ROMM is never queried during
inventory scans or export builds — only when `romm-sync` is explicitly run.

Requires `ROMM_URL` and `ROMM_TOKEN` in a `.env` file at the project root
(copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in both values).

Pagination size is configurable in `config.yaml` (default: 200 ROMs per page):

```yaml
romm:
  page_size: 200
```

Cached fields per ROM:

- `name` — ROMM display name
- `total_rating`, `aggregated_rating` — IGDB scores
- `is_identified` — whether ROMM matched this ROM to metadata
- `genres`, `themes`, `game_modes`, `player_count`
- `year`, `hltb_main`, `hltb_main_extra`, `hltb_completionist`
- `sibling_count`, `has_cover`, `regions`, `tags`
- `summary` — IGDB game description
- `developer`, `publisher` — from IGDB involved companies
- `url_cover` — cover image URL (used by `fetch-media`)
- `url_screenshots` — screenshot URLs (used by `fetch-media`)

After a sync, `Unresolved platforms: N` in the output means N ROMM platform
slugs did not match any canonical system in `mappings/layouts/romm.yaml`.
Those ROMs land with `canonical_system = NULL` and are excluded from all
exports and gamelist generation. To fix: add the missing slug to `romm.yaml`.

### RK3326 Hardware Compatibility Filtering

Community-tested compatibility lists for RK3326-based handhelds (R36S, R39 Max,
Odroid Go Super) can be imported and used to filter exports to ROMs that are
known to run acceptably on the hardware.

#### Import compatibility xlsx files

Download compatibility spreadsheets (e.g. from
[GazousGit/R36S-Game-Compatibility-Lists](https://github.com/GazousGit/R36S-Game-Compatibility-Lists))
and import them:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py compat-import Dreamcast.xlsx Saturn.xlsx N64.xlsx
python3 romcurator.py compat-import *.xlsx --chip rk3326
python3 romcurator.py compat-import SomeFile.xlsx --chip rk3326 --system psp
```

Imported YAML files are saved under `mappings/compat/<chip>/`:

```text
mappings/compat/rk3326/
├── atomiswave.yaml   ← matched by ROM filename stem
├── dreamcast.yaml    ← matched by normalised game title
├── n64.yaml
├── naomi.yaml
├── nds.yaml
├── psp.yaml
└── saturn.yaml
```

The importer auto-detects:
- Which system the file covers (from filename keywords)
- Which column contains game names and which contains the ROM identifier
- Whether to match by filename stem (Atomiswave/Naomi) or normalised title
  (Dreamcast/Saturn/N64/PSP/NDS)

Playability levels (highest to lowest): `Good`, `Ok`, `Ok/Medium`, `Medium`,
`Mediocre`, `None`.

#### Enable in a profile

```yaml
selection:
  compat_chip: rk3326
  compat_min_playability: Ok        # include Good and Ok
  compat_include_unlisted: true     # games not in the list are not penalised
  compat_unlisted_exclude:          # strict mode for well-covered systems
    - atomiswave
    - naomi
    - dreamcast
    - saturn
```

With `compat_unlisted_exclude`, only games with a confirmed compatibility entry
pass for those systems — useful when the compat list is comprehensive enough
that an absent entry likely means untested/broken.

The `explain` output includes a **Compat** column showing how many ROMs were
filtered per system.

### gamelist.xml Generation

Generate or update `gamelist.xml` for EmulationStation-compatible frontends
(Batocera, ES-DE, EmuDeck):

```bash
python3 romcurator.py gen-gamelist                              # dry-run all systems
python3 romcurator.py gen-gamelist --systems snes,megadrive,n64 # dry-run specific systems
python3 romcurator.py gen-gamelist --execute                    # write all systems
python3 romcurator.py gen-gamelist --systems snes,n64 --execute # write specific systems
```

For each system, the tool:

1. Queries the inventory database for all ROMs.
2. Resolves media assets from subfolders (see naming conventions below).
3. Pulls metadata from ROMM (name, rating, year, genre, players, description,
   developer, publisher) and from MAME (manufacturer for arcade ROMs).
4. Merges with any existing `gamelist.xml` — preserving user-edited fields
   (`desc`, `playcount`, `lastplayed`, `favorite`, `hidden`, `kidgame`).
5. Writes the result as pretty-printed XML to `<system>/gamelist.xml`.

Two media naming conventions are supported automatically (first match wins):

**Scraper-suffix style** (Batocera / Skyscraper):

```text
images/{title}-image.png      → <image>
images/{title}-thumb.png      → <thumbnail>
images/{title}-marquee.png    → <marquee>
videos/{title}-video.mp4      → <video>
```

**Plain-stem style** (MAME / ScreenScraper / RetroPie / fetch-media):

```text
images/{stem}.png             → <image>   (fallback after suffix style)
videos/{stem}.mp4             → <video>   (fallback after suffix style)
boxart/{stem}.png             → <image>
wheel/{stem}.png              → <marquee>
marquee/{stem}.png            → <marquee> (fallback)
logos/{stem}.png              → <marquee> (fallback)
snap/{stem}.mp4               → <video>
screenshots/{stem}.png        → <screenshot>
fanarts/{stem}.png            → <fanart>
flyer/{stem}.png              → <fanart>
```

**Subpath systems** (e.g. `mame2003-plus` with `nas: arcade/mame2003-plus`):
Media and `gamelist.xml` are read/written in the **parent** folder (`arcade/`)
per Batocera convention. ROM `<path>` entries are prefixed with the subfolder
name (e.g. `./mame2003-plus/1942.zip`), so both arcade and mame2003-plus
entries coexist in one `arcade/gamelist.xml`.

ROMM metadata is fetched correctly for subpath systems: when the parent folder
is `arcade/`, gen-gamelist also matches `romm_roms` rows with
`canonical_system='arcade'`, so mame2003-plus ROMs receive the same ROMM
descriptions, ratings, and other metadata as standard arcade ROMs.

Metadata priority per field:

| Field | Source priority |
|-------|----------------|
| `<name>` | ROMM display name → parsed filename title |
| `<desc>` | ROMM IGDB summary → preserved from existing gamelist |
| `<rating>` | ROMM IGDB total_rating (converted to 0.00–1.00) |
| `<releasedate>` | ROMM year / MAME year |
| `<developer>` | ROMM involved companies → MAME manufacturer → existing gamelist |
| `<publisher>` | ROMM involved companies → existing gamelist |
| `<genre>` | ROMM IGDB genres |
| `<players>` | ROMM player_count |

`gen-gamelist` requires `romm-sync` to have been run for ROMM fields to be
populated. Systems with no ROMM sync data still get a valid gamelist from local
media files and MAME data.

### ROMM Media Download

Download missing cover images and screenshots from ROMM to the NAS system
folders. Files are placed in the `boxart/` and `screenshots/` subfolders used
by `gen-gamelist`.

Dry-run (default) — shows what is already present vs what would be downloaded,
without making any HTTP requests:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py fetch-media                        # all systems
python3 romcurator.py fetch-media snes n64 megadrive     # specific systems
```

Download missing files:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py fetch-media --execute
python3 romcurator.py fetch-media snes n64 --execute
```

Dry-run output columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Covers on disk | `present / available from ROMM` |
| Covers to fetch | Files absent — would be downloaded |
| Shots on disk | `present / available from ROMM` |
| Shots to fetch | Files absent — would be downloaded |

Existing files are **never overwritten**. Only files absent from disk are
downloaded. This makes `fetch-media` safe to run after Skyscraper or
ScreenScraper has already populated some assets — it fills gaps without
replacing higher-quality scraped images.

Requires `romm-sync` to have been run first to populate the URL columns. A
configurable delay between requests (default 50 ms) keeps the local ROMM
server responsive:

```yaml
romm:
  page_size: 200
  media_delay: 0.05   # seconds between image downloads
```

### Arcade Classification

Import MAME machine metadata and classify arcade ROMs by sub-system:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py arcade-import              # stream from installed mame binary
python3 romcurator.py arcade-import --xml /path/to/mame.xml   # use cached XML file
python3 romcurator.py arcade-import --reset      # wipe mame_machines before importing
```

#### MAME version romset filtering

On lower-end devices (RK3326 and similar) only specific libretro cores work — typically `mame2003_libretro` and `mame2003_plus_libretro`, each of which supports a fixed frozen romset. Import those XMLs under a version label to restrict exports to compatible ROMs only:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py arcade-import --xml mame2003.xml      --version mame2003
python3 romcurator.py arcade-import --xml mame2003-plus.xml --version mame2003-plus
```

Then filter at export time:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py build r36s --mame-versions mame2003,mame2003-plus --execute
```

Or bake the filter into the profile permanently:

```yaml
selection:
  mame_versions: [mame2003, mame2003-plus]
```

`--version` imports only store machine names (lightweight). Full metadata (for `arcade-analyze` stats and control-type filtering) still requires a separate unversioned `arcade-import` from a full MAME XML.

The `r36s`, `r39max`, and `odroidgosuper` profiles include `mame_versions` by default.

Generates a pre-computed `mame.xml` with:

```bash
mame -listxml > /tmp/mame.xml
```

After import, arcade ROMs in the inventory are classified into sub-system buckets:

| Sub-system | Source |
|------------|--------|
| `cps1` | `capcom/cps1.cpp` |
| `cps2` | `capcom/cps2.cpp` |
| `cps3` | `capcom/cps3.cpp` |
| `neogeo` | `neogeo/neogeo.cpp` |
| `naomi` | `sega/naomi.cpp` |
| `naomi2` | `sega/naomi2.cpp` |
| `atomiswave` | `sega/atomiswave.cpp` |
| `mame` | everything else |

**Export routing**: when a profile lists `cps2` (or any other sub-system) as a system, classified arcade ROMs are automatically routed to that folder in the export — without touching or reorganizing the master archive.

Arcade ROMs that don't match a requested sub-system fall back to the `arcade` folder (if `arcade` is in the profile).

Classification is stored in the `arcade_system` column of the `roms` table and the `mame_machines` table. Re-run `arcade-import` to refresh after a MAME update.

#### DAT file storage convention

Store MAME XML DAT files under `mame-xml/` using the libretro core name as the filename:

```text
mame-xml/
├── mame2000.xml        ← MAME 0.37b5
├── mame2003.xml        ← MAME 0.78
├── mame2003-plus.xml   ← MAME 0.78+ (mame2003-plus core)
├── mame2010.xml        ← MAME 0.139
├── mame2014.xml        ← MAME 0.159
├── mame2016.xml        ← MAME 0.174 (arcade only)
└── mame2016-home.xml   ← MAME 0.174 (home systems)
```

DAT files can be plain `.xml`/`.dat` or `.zip` archives containing one — both are accepted by `arcade-import` and `dat-check`.

#### dat-check — identify your romset version

Compare a ROM folder against one or more MAME XML DAT files to identify which version the romset is from. **Read-only — no database changes.**

```bash
python3 romcurator.py dat-check /mnt/storage/roms/arcade mame-xml/mame2016.xml
```

Check against multiple DATs at once for a side-by-side coverage comparison:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py dat-check /mnt/storage/roms/arcade \
    mame-xml/mame2003-plus.xml \
    mame-xml/mame2014.xml \
    mame-xml/mame2016.xml
```

Output columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Machines (total) | Every entry in the DAT — parent ROMs plus all clones. In MAME, most games have many variants (regions, revisions, bootlegs) each with their own ROM file, so this count is much higher than the number of unique games. |
| Parents only | Unique games only — one entry per title, clones excluded. This is the real game count. |
| Matched in folder | How many of the DAT's entries (parents + clones) are physically present in your folder. |
| Folder match | **What % of your folder's files this DAT recognises.** This is the version indicator — the DAT with the highest value is most likely the source your romset came from. 100% means every file in your folder is known to this DAT. |
| Collection % | What % of the DAT's parent games you have. Low % = a small curated selection; 100% = a complete set. |
| Notes | Warnings: identical machine list to another DAT (mislabelled zip), or `← best match` when comparing multiple DATs. |

**Folder match vs Collection %** answer different questions:
- *"Which MAME version is my romset from?"* → look at **Folder match** (highest = source version)
- *"How complete is my collection?"* → look at **Collection %**

Example: a folder with 373 hand-picked games from a mame2016 romset would show ~98% Folder match for mame2016 (almost all files recognised) but only ~3% Collection % (373 out of 10,797 possible parent games).

When multiple DATs are compared, the best-matching one is flagged with `← best match` and a summary line is printed:

```
Best match: mame2016 — 98% of folder files recognised (368 / 373)
```

A perfect match (100% Folder match, 0 unmatched) confirms the folder is a complete romset for that version:

```
│ mame2003-plus │  5257 │  2926 │  5256 │  100% │  100% │
Unmatched in any DAT: 0 files
```

DATs with identical machine lists are automatically flagged (e.g. a mislabelled zip).

Add `--detail` to list files in the folder that are not found in any DAT:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py dat-check /mnt/storage/roms/arcade mame-xml/mame2016.xml --detail
```

```bash
python3 romcurator.py --roms /path/to/roms-test --database /tmp/test.sqlite inventory
python3 romcurator.py --database /tmp/test.sqlite report
python3 romcurator.py --database /tmp/test.sqlite --exports /tmp/exports explain r36s
```

## Configuration

Default config lives at:

```text
config.yaml
```

Important keys:

```yaml
paths:
  roms: /mnt/storage/roms
  database: /mnt/storage/curator/inventory.sqlite
  exports: /mnt/storage/exports
  reports: /mnt/storage/curator/reports
  recycle_bin: /mnt/storage/recycle_bin
  mappings: mappings/systems.yaml
  profiles: profiles

scan:
  incremental: true
  ignore_hidden: true
  follow_symlinks: false

romm:
  page_size: 200       # ROMs per API page during romm-sync
  media_delay: 0.05    # seconds between requests during fetch-media
```

ROMM credentials go in `.env` (never in `config.yaml`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set ROMM_URL and ROMM_TOKEN
```

For first tests, point `--roms` at a small sample tree instead of the full NAS
archive.

## Ignored Files

Inventory skips common non-ROM clutter:

- `.DS_Store`
- `Thumbs.db`
- `desktop.ini`
- `._*`
- `.srm`
- `.state`

It also ignores hidden directories and selected non-ROM directories such as:

- `.git`
- `cache`
- `savestates`

## Installation

Python 3.11+ is recommended.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:

- PyYAML
- rich
- httpx (required for `romm-sync` and `fetch-media`)
- python-dotenv (required for `romm-sync` and `fetch-media`)
- openpyxl (required for `compat-import`)

### Archive Maintenance Tools

These commands modify the NAS source archive. They are **dry-run only** by default and require `--execute` to make real changes. Files are always moved to the recycle bin rather than deleted.

#### zip-roms

Compress uncompressed single-file ROMs (.nes, .sfc, .gba, etc.) into individual .zip archives in place. The original is moved to the recycle bin after the zip is verified.

```bash
python3 romcurator.py zip-roms               # dry-run all systems
python3 romcurator.py zip-roms --system gba  # dry-run one system
python3 romcurator.py zip-roms --execute     # actually zip
```

CD-ROM formats (.bin/.cue, .iso, .img) are intentionally skipped — they involve companion files and need manual handling. After execution, re-run `inventory` to update the database.

#### dedup-roms

Identify duplicate ROMs (same title, multiple regions or variants) using inventory database metadata, and move the lower-priority copies to the recycle bin.

```bash
python3 romcurator.py dedup-roms                             # dry-run all systems
python3 romcurator.py dedup-roms --system snes               # dry-run one system
python3 romcurator.py dedup-roms --preferred-regions USA Europe Japan --execute
```

Priority ordering (highest wins):
1. Region — matches `--preferred-regions` order
2. Not-beta > beta
3. Not-proto > proto
4. Not-hack > hack
5. Compressed format (.zip > .7z > .chd > .cso > .pbp > .iso > .bin > .img > raw)
6. Filename alphabetical

Files that are never considered duplicates:
- `.cue`, `.gdi`, `.sub`, `.sbi`, `.m3u` — companion/cuesheet files that must travel with their primary disc image
- Files inside game subfolders of `folder_based` systems (e.g. ScummVM data files, megacd audio tracks, switch update packages)

Run `inventory` to rebuild the database after execution.

#### clean-media

Remove orphaned media files — images, videos, boxart, wheel art, and other
scraper assets — whose corresponding ROM no longer exists in the inventory.

```bash
python3 romcurator.py clean-media                            # dry-run all systems
python3 romcurator.py clean-media --systems snes             # dry-run one system
python3 romcurator.py clean-media --systems snes,nes --execute
python3 romcurator.py clean-media --media-folders boxart,wheel --execute
```

Scanned subfolders (default, all configurable via `--media-folders`):
`images`, `videos`, `snap`, `boxart`, `wheel`, `cartart`, `mixart`,
`manuals`, `logos`, `fanarts`, `backcovers`, `screenshots`, `marquees`, `media`

Two naming conventions are matched automatically:

| Convention | Example | Matched against |
|---|---|---|
| Full ROM stem | `7th Saga, The (USA).png` | ROM filename stem |
| Scraper suffix | `7th Saga, The-image.png` | Parsed ROM title after stripping `-image`/`-thumb`/`-marquee`/`-video`/… |

System files (`Thumbs.db`, `.DS_Store`, `gamelist.xml`, etc.) are always skipped.

Run `inventory --systems <system>` first to ensure the database is up to date
before executing, so recently added ROMs are not incorrectly flagged.

#### gen-m3u

Generate `.m3u` playlist files for multi-disc games. The tool reads the
inventory database for ROMs that have a disc tag (`Disc 1`, `Side A`, `Tape 2`,
…) and writes one `.m3u` per game into the system's root folder.

```bash
python3 romcurator.py gen-m3u                          # dry-run all systems
python3 romcurator.py gen-m3u --systems psx,ps2        # dry-run specific systems
python3 romcurator.py gen-m3u --execute                # write .m3u files
```

Each `.m3u` lists disc filenames in disc-number order. Existing files are
compared against the expected content and shown as `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, or
`UNCHANGED` — only files that actually need changing are written.

Folder-based systems (switch, scummvm, etc.) are skipped; `.m3u` is relevant
for flat disc-image systems (PSX, PS2, Saturn, Dreamcast with CHDs, etc.).

Disc naming patterns recognised by the parser:

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| Standard No-Intro | `(Disc 1)`, `(Disk 2)`, `(Side A)`, `(Tape 1)`, `(Part 2)` |
| Region before disc | `(NA - Disc 1)`, `(EU - Disc 2)` |
| Disc before region | `(Disc 1 - EU)`, `(Disc 2 - English Patch)` |
| Amiga / C64 / MSX style | `Disk 1`, `Disk A`, `Disk1`, `DiskA`, `Disk 0` |

#### Recycle bin

All four archive maintenance tools move files to the recycle bin under their
original relative path:

```
<recycle_bin>/roms/<system>/<filename>
```

The recycle bin path is configured under `paths.recycle_bin` in `config.yaml` (default: `/mnt/storage/recycle_bin`).

### System Discovery

#### scan-systems

Scan the ROM root for subdirectories and compare against `mappings/systems.yaml`:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py scan-systems
```

Reports three categories:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Known systems — folder present | In mappings and directory exists on disk |
| Known systems — folder absent | Defined in mappings but no directory found |
| Unknown folders | Directory exists but not in mappings — add to mappings or exclude |

Hidden directories (starting with `.`) are skipped automatically via
`scan.ignore_hidden`. Additional folders can be excluded permanently in
`config.yaml`:

```yaml
scan:
  exclude_system_folders: [.curator, .exports]
```

#### compare-systems

Compare discovered system folders against one profile's `include_systems` list:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py compare-systems r36s
```

Shows three categories with ready-to-run hint commands:

| Category | Action hint |
|----------|------------|
| Included (folder present) | Already in sync |
| Not in profile but folder present | `profile-add` hint printed |
| In profile but folder missing | `profile-remove` hint printed |

Use `profile-add` and `profile-remove` to act on the suggestions:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py profile-add r36s amiga500,amiga1200
python3 romcurator.py profile-remove r36s megadrive
```

#### folder-check — find duplicates across folders

Compare a source folder against a target folder to identify which files are already present before consolidating or deleting. **Read-only — no database changes, no files moved.**

```bash
python3 romcurator.py folder-check /mnt/storage/roms/cps1 /mnt/storage/roms/arcade
```

Each file in the source is categorised:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ✓ Same name + size | Identical file already in target — safe to delete from source |
| ⚠ Same name, different size | Different ROM version (different CRC) — keep both, do not overwrite |
| ✗ Not in target | Only in source — would be lost if source folder is deleted |

Size mismatches are always printed. Add `--detail` to also list safe-to-delete and missing files:

```bash
python3 romcurator.py folder-check /mnt/storage/roms/cps1 /mnt/storage/roms/arcade --detail
```

Filter by extension (default: all common ROM extensions):

```bash
python3 romcurator.py folder-check /mnt/storage/roms/cps1 /mnt/storage/roms/arcade --ext zip,7z
```

Typical use: before consolidating separate sub-system folders (`cps1/`, `cps2/`, `neogeo/`) into a single `arcade/` folder, run `folder-check` on each to confirm all files are already present and flag any version mismatches.

## Not Implemented Yet

- `arcade_exclude_controls` has no effect until `arcade-import` is run from a full `mame -listxml` source — run `mame -listxml > mame_full.xml && python3 romcurator.py arcade-import --xml mame_full.xml --reset` to activate it
